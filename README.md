About
---

This repository is meant to serve as a template to support development of API services using python. We use connexion/
flask to simplify deploying logic into API endpoints.

To get started, copy the contents of this repository into a new one and start writing API specifications, creating
database schemas, and write code to back API functions that have been defined. For full documentation of connexion use,
refer to the [official documentation](https://connexion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
